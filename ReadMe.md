  <h1>👋 Hi, I'm Kamil – aka Shikaru</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a hobby developer who enjoys building Discord bots, websites, and small digital experiments.<br>
    Most of what I know comes from learning by doing – I just love figuring things out on my own.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy coding, gaming, music, and hanging out with friends.
  </p>
